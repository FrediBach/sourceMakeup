// # sourceMakeup
//
// sourceMakeup is a source code viewer written in PHP on the backend, and jQuery and jKit
// on the frontend. sourceMakeup was heavely inspired by the first versions of 
// [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/), with some additional features that enhance
// the frontend visually and feature wise. It was mainly developed as a source code viewer
// for the jQuery based UI toolkit [jKit](http://jquery-jkit.com/). It's main use is to
// create beautiful source documentation for JavaScript libraries and plugins, but it can
// be used to document small PHP code and CSS markup as well, however, with some limitations. 
//
// Comments for sourceMakeup should be written in Markdown. This way sourceMakeup can correctly
// and beautifully format the code and add a navigation menu linked to the different parts of your code.
